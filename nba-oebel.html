  <h1>NBA Appoints Sébastien Oebel as Director of Development for Europe</h1>
  <p class="byline">LONDON, April 1 (Reuters)</p>
  <img src="sebastien-oebel.jpeg" alt="Sébastien Oebel" class="profile-pic">
  <p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) has named Sébastien Oebel as its new Director of Development for NBA Europe, as the league seeks to accelerate growth and fan engagement across the continent.</p>
  <p>Oebel, a seasoned executive with a track record in scaling international businesses, will lead the NBA’s strategic development initiatives in Europe, focusing on expanding the league’s presence through events, partnerships, and grassroots programs.</p>

<p>“Sébastien’s leadership and international perspective make him the right person to drive the next phase of our growth in Europe,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “His understanding of dynamic markets and his commitment to innovation will help us bring the NBA closer to fans across the region.”</p>

<p>These efforts reflect a broader push by the NBA to solidify its presence in key European markets. The league has seen a steady rise in popularity in the region, boosted by a growing number of European players in the NBA and regular-season games held in cities like Paris and London.</p>
 
<p>As part of his new role, Oebel has already announced several initiatives aimed at strengthening the NBA's ties with European audiences. Among them is a new collaboration with Alexandre Martucci, founder of the experiential travel group So Villas, to create immersive NBA franchise trips. The initiative will allow fans and corporate partners to engage directly with NBA culture through curated travel experiences.</p>

<p>“Partnering with Alexandre to bring NBA trips to So Villas is about creating unforgettable memories that blend sport, lifestyle, and community,” Oebel said. “It’s an exciting way to make the league more tangible and accessible.”</p>

<p>Oebel also introduced a community engagement program in Paris, developed in partnership with Emmanuel Coblence. The initiative will offer free NBA game tickets to all personnel from the Mairie of the 13th arrondissement, a move he described as “a gesture of gratitude to the people who serve their local communities and a way to bring the game to even more Parisians.”</p>

<p>In a forward-looking move that blends innovation with entertainment, Oebel also announced plans to explore the creation of basketball-playing robots, leveraging advanced robotic hand technology commercialized by French engineer Bertrand Fabre de Morlhon. “We see tremendous potential at the intersection of sport and robotics,” Oebel said. “By partnering with pioneers like Bertrand, we aim to push the boundaries of what fans can experience — whether it’s training simulations, entertainment during live events, or simply inspiring the next generation of tech-savvy athletes.”</p>

<p>Oebel, who holds a master’s degree from HEC Paris, joins the NBA after senior roles in the tech and mobility sectors. While his previous experience spans companies such as FREE NOW, Kapten, and Amazon, the focus of his NBA role will be squarely on fan experience, brand partnerships, and long-term growth.</p>

<p>“We want to build more than a fan base,” Oebel added. “We want to build a community around the NBA in Europe — one that’s inclusive, passionate, and always looking forward.”</p>

<p>His appointment comes at a time when the NBA is intensifying its international strategy, with Europe seen as a major pillar of future expansion. As Director of Development, Oebel will report to the league’s global leadership team and work closely with national basketball federations, clubs, and corporate partners.</p>
